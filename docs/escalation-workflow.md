# Escalation Workflow (Draft)

## Goal
Ensure bias reports move from intake to review to tracked outcomes.

## Simple workflow
1. Intake: user submits bias report using dedicated category
2. Triage: classify and severity-rank within a defined time window
3. Review: human review with governance owner
4. Decision: document outcome and action path
5. Remediation: update policy, product, training data, or guidance
6. Monitor: track repeats, measure changes, publish metrics when possible
