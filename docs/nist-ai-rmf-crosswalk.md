# NIST AI RMF Crosswalk (Draft)

## Purpose
This crosswalk maps this Governance Framework to the NIST AI RMF functions: Govern, Map, Measure, Manage.

## Govern
- Define reporting channels for representational/structural bias
- Assign ownership for triage and response
- Require documentation and audit trails

## Map
- Identify AI use cases and impacted groups
- Document harm types (including representational bias)
- Record context: domain, users, and decision impact

## Measure
- Use evaluation methods to detect bias patterns
- Collect evidence and examples
- Link to evaluation artifacts (toolkit outputs)

## Manage
- Escalation path, decisions, remediation actions
- Ongoing monitoring and review cadence
- Track outcomes and lessons learned
