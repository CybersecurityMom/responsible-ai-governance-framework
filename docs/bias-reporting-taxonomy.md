# Bias Reporting Taxonomy (Draft)

## Why this exists
Bias that cannot be clearly categorized cannot be tracked or governed.

## Suggested report categories
1. Representational harm (stereotypes, erasure, demeaning portrayals)
2. Structural bias (system patterns that disadvantage groups)
3. Allocation harm (denied opportunities, ranking issues, visibility)
4. Quality-of-service harm (worse performance for certain groups)
5. Transparency harm (unclear outputs, misleading confidence)

## Minimum report fields
- What happened (copy/paste output)
- Where it happened (product + feature)
- Who was impacted (as described by user)
- Why it matters (context: hiring, school, work, etc.)
- Desired outcome (correction, tracking, escalation, guidance)
