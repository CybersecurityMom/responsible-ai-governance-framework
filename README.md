## What This Is
This repository contains a Responsible AI Governance Framework focused on a critical but under-addressed issue: bias that cannot be clearly reported cannot be tracked, and bias that cannot be tracked becomes unmanaged risk.

This framework treats representational and structural bias as a governance and system design concern, not solely a model behavior or moderation issue. It is designed to support auditable, repeatable, and accountable AI risk management practices.

## Why This Framework Exists
AI systems are increasingly used in high-impact contexts such as hiring, evaluation, content creation, and professional representation. In these contexts, risk must be measurable, reportable, and governed.

Many AI platforms provide reporting mechanisms scoped primarily to explicit policy or safety violations. Fairness-related harms, including representational and structural bias, often lack a dedicated user-facing reporting pathway. This design limitation creates governance blind spots.

This framework exists to document and address that gap.

## The Core Governance Gap
When representational or structural bias cannot be accurately reported, it cannot be reliably tracked. When it cannot be tracked, it cannot be governed. When it cannot be governed, it persists as unmanaged organizational and societal risk.

This is not primarily a moderation failure. It is a governance and system design limitation.

## Theory of Change
If bias reporting is structurally supported, it can be measured.  
If it can be measured, it can be governed.  
If it can be governed, it can be managed as risk.

This framework is built on the principle that measurement enables governance, and governance enables risk management.

## Alignment with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)
This framework aligns to the NIST AI RMF functions: Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage.

### Govern
Establish ownership, accountability, policies, and reporting infrastructure for AI systems. Define who receives bias reports, how they are reviewed, what decisions are made, and how outcomes are documented.

### Map
Identify AI use cases, impacted stakeholders, and potential harm types, including representational and structural bias, particularly in high-impact decision-making contexts.

### Measure
Evaluate AI systems using evidence-based assessments, documentation, and repeatable evaluation processes. Measurement includes tracking bias reports, identifying patterns, and maintaining audit trails.

### Manage
Define escalation paths, remediation actions, monitoring practices, and continuous improvement processes. Management includes documenting outcomes and tracking systemic issues over time.

## Bias Reporting as Core Infrastructure
Bias reporting must be treated as core governance infrastructure. This includes clear reporting categories, a user-facing intake mechanism, internal review workflows, tracking mechanisms, and documented outcomes.

Without this infrastructure, organizations cannot reliably quantify fairness-related risk or demonstrate responsible AI governance.

## Governance Components Supported by This Framework
This framework supports:
Clear governance framing for representational and structural bias  
Alignment of bias reporting to enterprise risk management practices  
Auditable tracking and accountability mechanisms  
Integration with existing evaluation and risk frameworks  

## Case Study Foundation
This framework is informed by a documented real-world case identifying a confirmed gap in AI bias reporting pathways within a widely used generative AI system. The case demonstrates how reporting limitations prevent accurate categorization, tracking, and governance of representational bias.

## Connection to the Responsible AI Evaluation Toolkit
This Governance Framework is designed to work alongside the Responsible AI Evaluation Toolkit, which supports the Measure and Manage functions of the NIST AI RMF.

## How to Use This Framework
Organizations and practitioners can use this framework to:
Assess gaps in AI governance and reporting infrastructure  
Design or improve bias reporting and escalation pathways  
Align responsible AI practices to NIST AI RMF principles  
Support policy development, audits, and governance reviews
