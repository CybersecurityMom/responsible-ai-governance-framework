# Responsible AI Governance Framework

## What This Is
This framework documents how to manage AI risk as governance infrastructure, including bias reporting, accountability, and auditable tracking.

## Why This Framework Exists
AI systems are used in hiring, evaluation, content creation, and professional representation. If representational or structural bias cannot be clearly reported, it cannot be tracked or governed. What is not tracked becomes unmanaged risk.

## The Core Governance Gap
Current reporting tools are often scoped to policy violations and do not provide dedicated user-facing channels for representational or structural bias reporting.

## Theory of Change
If bias reporting is structurally supported, it can be measured. If it can be measured, it can be governed. If it can be governed, it can be managed as risk.

## Alignment to NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)

### Govern
Define roles, ownership, decision rights, reporting channels, and accountability for AI risk.

### Map
Document where AI is used, who is impacted, and what harm types exist, including representational and structural bias.

### Measure
Evaluate AI system behavior and outcomes using evidence, testing, and documentation.

### Manage
Escalate issues, remediate, monitor over time, and document decisions and changes.

## Bias Reporting as Core Infrastructure
Bias reporting must be treated as a core governance function with clear categories, a user-facing intake path, internal review workflows, and tracking.

## Case Study
This framework is informed by a documented case showing a confirmed gap in bias reporting pathways. (Link to published letter can be added here.)

## Connection to the Responsible AI Evaluation Toolkit
This Governance Framework complements the Responsible AI Evaluation Toolkit:

## Next Tiny Steps
1. Add a bias reporting taxonomy
2. Add an escalation workflow
3. Add a NIST crosswalk table
4. Add templates and a simple case study format
